        <p>As of right now, I do not have any projects to show, but I can talk about one I am working on now. For my database class, my team and I are working on implementing a database for a company from stratch. We have created an ERD, the logical design, the physical design and now implementing it into a database and writing SQL using SQL Server. I have learned that it takes patience and practice when it comes to implementing a database. Start from the beginning has been very insightful to see all of the time and dedication it takes to implement a database that is relatively simple compared to the real world. This practice and knowledge I have gained from this will help me in the future.</p>

        <p> I will update this page as I complete projects that are ready to be displayed</p>
